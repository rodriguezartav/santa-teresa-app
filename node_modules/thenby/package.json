  "readme": "thenBy.js\n=========\n\n`thenBy` is a javascript micro library that helps sorting arrays on multiple keys. It allows you to use the [native Array::sort() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) of javascript, but pass in multiple functions to sort that are composed with `firstBy().thenBy().thenBy()` style.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\n// first by length of name, then by population, then by ID\ndata.sort(\n    firstBy(function (v1, v2) { return v1.name.length - v2.name.length; })\n    .thenBy(function (v1, v2) { return v1.population - v2.population; })\n    .thenBy(function (v1, v2) { return v1.id - v2.id; });\n);\n\n```\n\nTo include it into your page/project, just paste the minified code from https://raw.github.com/Teun/thenBy.js/master/thenBy.min.js into yours (137 characters). \n\nThanks a lot to https://github.com/bergus for his improvements.\n",
